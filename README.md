# University of Texas at Tyler --- Unofficial Thesis Template

This LaTeX document should be a great starting point for any
math or computer science (or other STEM field) thesis, or smaller
paper. It has a nice title page, and includes two options for
the university seal/logo.

It uses the `memoir` document class, which is a new style
primarily intended for typesetting books and prose, but which
works very well for math with a few tweaks. It has a much nicer
macro interface than the `article` or `book` class, and takes
care of a lot of things in the background.

### Fonts

The default font is EB Garamond, an open-source implementation
of Claude Garamont's classic French Renaissance/15th cent. typeface.
If EB Garamond doesn't suit you,
1. are you nuts, and
2. I recommend you check out Coelacanth, a Centaur-derived typeface.
Other good options are:
- Alegreya
- Palatino
- Crimson
- Bembo
and any other oldstyle typeface that has had some effort put in to it.
